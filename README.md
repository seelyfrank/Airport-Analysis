### Description
This is our first project in data science, which introduced us to the critical steps
of a simple data pipeline. The main Jupyter file takes the reader through each step
we took to clean and prepare our dataset and argument columns and explore initial patterns
within a Kaggle flight log dataset and a second dataset containing IATA airline codes
(e.g., JFK, BOS) with related information. 

Finally, we attempt some statistical tests as well as basic machine-learning models 
to attempt to find relationships between flight features
and our target variable -- whether or not a flight is delayed.

The PDF included in this repository is a detailed report on our findings.

Thanks for reading!
